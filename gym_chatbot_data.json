      "response": "The EZ-bar skullcrusher is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. The EZ-bar is used more often than a straight bar. As for the name, that\u2019s worst-case scenario. The bar should actually come down behind the head. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper body or arms-focused workout. No need to chase a 1RM on this move!\n\n**Body Part**: Triceps\n**Equipment**: E-Z Curl Bar\n**Level**: Intermediate"
